TO DO APP STATEMENT


Problem Statement

Keeping track of daily tasks can get messy really fast. Some things end up in notes, some in random apps, and a lot of it just lives in our heads. Because of this, important tasks are often forgotten or mixed up.
This project aims to solve that problem by creating a small desktop To-Do app where users can easily add tasks, choose a due date, set a priority, and manage everything in one simple place.


Scope

The project focuses on building a basic task manager using Python and Tkinter. It includes:
A simple GUI for adding and viewing tasks
A calendar widget to pick dates
Saving and loading tasks through a text file
Deleting selected tasks
It doesn’t include advanced features like user accounts, cloud sync, reminders, or sorting functions. The goal is to keep it simple, clean, and beginner-friendly.


Target Users

This app is meant for:
Students who want an easy planner for assignments
Anyone who prefers a lightweight, offline desktop tool
Beginners learning Python and GUI development
Users who want something straightforward rather than a complicated app


High-Level Features

Add Tasks: Enter task name, due date, and priority
Calendar Input: Pick dates easily using a small calendar widget
Task Table: View all tasks in a neat and scrollable list
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks once they’re done
Auto Save & Load: Tasks are saved automatically and appear again when the app is reopened
Clean UI: Simple design that’s easy to understand and use


Conclusion

This project helped me understand how Python GUI programs work, how data is stored, and how different widgets come together to form a working application. Even though it’s a basic app, it’s practical and gives a good foundation for adding more features in the future.
