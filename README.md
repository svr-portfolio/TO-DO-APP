# TO-DO-APP
A basic desktop To-Do application made with Python and Tkinter. You can add tasks, choose a date from a calendar, set a priority, and delete tasks when they’re done. Everything gets saved automatically, so your tasks load back when you reopen the app. A straightforward project to learn Python GUI development.
